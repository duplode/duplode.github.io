    <h2>Migrating a Project to stack</h2>

    
      <p>This post consists of notes on how I converted one of my Haskell projects to stack. It provides a small illustration of how flexible stack can be in accomodating project organisation quirks on the way towards predictable builds.

    <h2>Casual Hacking With stack</h2>

    
      <p>Sandboxes are exceptionally helpful not just for working in long-term Haskell projects, but also for casual experiments. While playing around, we tend to install all sorts of packages in a carefree way, which increases a lot the risk of entering cabal hell. While vanilla cabal-install sandboxes prevent such a disaster, using them systematically for experiments mean that, unless you are meticulous, you will end up either with dozens of .hs files in a single sandbox or with dozens of copies of the libraries strewn across your home directory. And no one likes to be meticulous while playing around. In that context, stack, the recently released alternative to cabal-install, can prevent trouble with installing packages in a way more manageable than through ad-hoc sandboxes. In this post, I will suggest a few ways of using stack that may be convenient for experiments. I have been using stack for only a few days, therefore suggestions are most welcome!</p>

    <h2>Applicative Archery</h2>

    
      <p>It is widely agreed that the laws of the <code>Applicative</code> class are not pretty to look at.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">pure id <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> v <span class="fu">=</span> v                            <span class="co">-- identity</span>
pure f <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> pure x <span class="fu">=</span> pure (f x)               <span class="co">-- homomorphism</span>
u <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> pure y <span class="fu">=</span> pure (<span class="fu">$</span> y) <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> u              <span class="co">-- interchange</span>
pure (<span class="fu">.</span>) <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> u <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> v <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> w <span class="fu">=</span> u <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> (v <span class="fu">&lt;*&gt;</span> w) <span class="co">-- composition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Monad laws, in comparison, not only look less odd to begin with but can also be stated in a much more elegant way in terms of Kleisli composition <code>(&lt;=&lt;)</code>. Shouldn’t there be an analogous nice presentation for <code>Applicative</code> as well? That became a static question in my mind while I was studying applicative functors many moons ago. After finding surprisingly little commentary on this issue, I decided to try figuring it out by myself.

    <h2>What Does fmap Preserve?</h2>

    
      <p>A common way of introducing <code>fmap</code> is saying that it only changes the values in a container, and not its structure. Leaving behind the the functors-as-containers metaphor, we can convey the same idea by saying that <code>fmap</code> leaves the context of the values in a <code>Functor</code> unchanged. But what, exactly, is the “context” or “structure” being preserved? “It depends on the functor”, though correct, is not an entirely satisfactory answer. The functor laws, after all, are highly abstract, and make no mention of anything a programmer would be inclined to call “structure” (say, the skeleton of a list); and yet the preservation we alluded to follows from them. After struggling a bit with this question, I realised that the incompatibility is only apparent. This post shows how the tension can be resolved through the mediation of <em>parametricity</em> and <em>naturality</em>, two concepts from different domains that are intertwined in Haskell.</p>

    <h2>Lenses You Can Make at Home</h2>

    
      <p>The most striking traits of the <code>lens</code> library are its astonishing breadth and generality. And yet, the whole edifice is built around van Laarhoven lenses, which are a simple and elegant concept. In this hands-on exposition, I will show how the <code>Lens</code> type can be understood without prerequisites other than a passing acquaintance with Haskell functors. Encouraging sound intuition in an accessible manner can go a long way towards making <code>lens</code> and lenses less intimidating.</p>
