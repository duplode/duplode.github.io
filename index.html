    <h2>What Does fmap Preserve?</h2>

    
      <p>A common way of introducing <code>fmap</code> is saying that it only changes the values in a container, and not its structure. Leaving behind the the functors-as-containers metaphor, we can convey the same idea by saying that <code>fmap</code> leaves the context of the values in a <code>Functor</code> unchanged. But what, exactly, is the “context” or “structure” being preserved? “It depends on the functor”, though correct, is not an entirely satisfactory answer. The functor laws, after all, are highly abstract, and make no mention of anything a programmer would be inclined to call “structure” (say, the skeleton of a list); and yet the preservation we alluded to follows from them. After struggling a bit with this question, I realised that the incompatibility is only apparent. This post shows how the tension can be resolved through the mediation of <em>parametricity</em> and <em>naturality</em>, two concepts from different domains that are intertwined in Haskell.</p>

    <h2>Lenses You Can Make at Home</h2>

    
      <p>The most striking traits of the <code>lens</code> library are its astonishing breadth and generality. And yet, the whole edifice is built around van Laarhoven lenses, which are a simple and elegant concept. In this hands-on exposition, I will show how the <code>Lens</code> type can be understood without prerequisites other than a passing acquaintance with Haskell functors. Encouraging sound intuition in an accessible manner can go a long way towards making <code>lens</code> and lenses less intimidating.</p>
