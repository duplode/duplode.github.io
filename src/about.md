title: About
---
I am Daniel Mlot, a Brazilian citizen, philosophy student and Haskell
hacker. Around the Internet I am best known as Duplode (capitalisation
optional). I can be spotted in locations such as:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/duplode), where you can find the
  [sources of this blog](https://github.com/duplode/duplode.github.io/tree/sources).
- [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Duplode), where I watch
  over and contribute to the Haskell Wikibook.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2751851/duplode).
  There, I can occasionaly be found hanging around the Haskell tag.
- [ZakStunts](http://zak.stunts.hu), the hub for all things Stunts.
  What is [Stunts](http://wiki.stunts.hu), you ask? It is the best racing game ever.
